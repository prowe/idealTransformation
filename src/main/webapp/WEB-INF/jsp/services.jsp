					<p><strong>Focus on your whole being</strong> – from exercise and nutrition to support and motivation, we’ll take a holistic approach to behavior modification. Emotional, physical, behavioral, nutritional, and lifestyle factors work in concert towards enhanced health and well-being.</p>
					<p><strong>Establish a connection</strong> – one of the most important things you and your health coach will do is work to establish a bond built on genuineness, respect, and trust.</p> 
					<p><strong>Set Goals</strong> - With an understanding of your personal interests, past successes and failures, your attitudes and beliefs about health and fitness, and your readiness to change, a health coach will work with you to establish goals. You will establish both short- and long-term goals that are continually revisited to help you take vague ideas and aspirations and transform them into reality.</p>
					<p><strong>Think differently</strong> - health coaches help clients establish positive self-talk by identifying negative, irrational and erroneous beliefs. By becoming aware of situations where negative self-talk occurs, health coaches help you shift to a more accurate and positive way of thinking.</p> 
					<p><strong>Overcome barriers</strong> - from lack of time to financial constraints, inclement weather, injury or medical issues, there are a number of environmental and lifestyle factors that often serve as external barriers for people trying to lose weight or improve their overall health. Coupled with internal barriers such as low self-esteem and intimidation, a health coach will work with you to diffuse anxieties and identify misconceptions that may be standing in the way of you reaching your goals.</p> 
					<p><strong>Become self-reliant</strong> – the ultimate goal of a health coach is to help you increase your motivation to adopt healthy habits.  From creating and maintaining an environment that fosters success to finding and implementing a support system, a health coach is committed to arm you with tools you need to succeed in reaching your goals.</p>
					<p><strong>Create a lifestyle</strong> - Health coaches enable individuals to see the value in reaching their health-related goals and building a true connection between exercise and activities of daily living. A health coach will empower you to take ownership of your experience and create positive, lasting lifestyle changes that enhance what you do in the gym and in everyday life.</p>
