				<h4>MARY</h4>
				<p>We are so fortunate to have Mary as our Medical Director.  Mary is exactly everything you would expect a good nurse to be.  She is soft spoken and sweet… and confident and strong!  Mary studied at Drake University and received her RN status with honors from Methodist School of Nursing in Des Moines.  Graduating second in her class, she was recognized for her scholastic achievements and awarded a scholarship for Critical Care Nursing.  Mary worked in Pediatric Critical Care at Methodist Hospital, and later served as Director of Nursing at Calvin Community.  Following her career at Calvin, she went into hospice nursing until she retired.  Mary maintains her certifications and works as a grief counselor at Deerfield Retirement Community.  Her and her husband, Pat, live on a farmstead outside of Des Moines and divide their time between their children, six grandchildren, volunteering and traveling.  When Mary has a moment of her own, she snuggles up with a good book!</p>
